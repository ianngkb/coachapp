# CoachConnect - Coach Booking Marketplace

A mobile-first scheduling platform that empowers coaches to easily share their availability and manage lessons, while giving students a simple way to discover, book, and manage coaching sessions ‚Äî all in one place.

## üéØ Vision Statement

**"The Calendly for Coaches"** - Unlike general-purpose scheduling tools, this app is built specifically for coaching with a public coach directory as its centerpiece, focusing on discovery, booking, and coaching workflows.

## üöÄ Project Status

This project is currently in the **planning and documentation phase**. No source code has been implemented yet. The `/mind` directory contains comprehensive specifications that serve as the foundation for development.

## üìã Core Value Proposition

- Easy tools to set availability and prevent double booking
- Visibility to new students they might never reach otherwise

### For Students
- Browse a directory of available coaches
- See up-to-date availability (in GMT+8)
- Book instantly ‚Äî no back-and-forth

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) + React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design tokens
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library

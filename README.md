# CoachConnect - Coach Booking Marketplace

A mobile-first scheduling platform that empowers coaches to easily share their availability and manage lessons, while giving students a simple way to discover, book, and manage coaching sessions — all in one place.

## 🎯 Vision Statement

**"The Calendly for Coaches"** - Unlike general-purpose scheduling tools, this app is built specifically for coaching with a public coach directory as its centerpiece, focusing on discovery, booking, and coaching workflows.

## 🚀 Project Status

This project is currently in the **planning and documentation phase**. No source code has been implemented yet. The `/mind` directory contains comprehensive specifications that serve as the foundation for development.

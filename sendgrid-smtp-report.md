## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

The issue is specifically with your **SendGrid SMTP configuration in Supabase**. The authentication and user creation systems are working perfectly - only email delivery is failing.

## 📋 Required Fix Actions

### 1. Verify SendGrid API Key
- Go to [SendGrid API Keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys)
- Ensure your API key has **"Mail Send"** permissions
- Copy the complete API key (starts with `SG.`)
- Verify it hasn't been revoked or expired

### 2. Check Sender Authentication
- Go to [SendGrid Sender Authentication](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth)
- Verify your sender email address or domain
- Complete DNS verification if using domain authentication
- Use only verified emails as "from" address

### 3. Review Supabase SMTP Settings
Navigate to: **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → SMTP**

**Required Settings** (per Twilio documentation):
```
Host: smtp.sendgrid.net
Port: 587
Username: apikey
Password: [Your SendGrid API Key]
From Email: [Your verified sender email]
From Name: [Your app name]
```

**Critical Notes**:
- Username must be literally `"apikey"` (not your SendGrid username)
- Password is your actual SendGrid API key
- From Email must be verified in SendGrid

### 4. Test SMTP Connection
- Use the **"Test SMTP Settings"** button in Supabase dashboard
- Check [SendGrid Activity Feed](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity) for delivery attempts
- Look for specific error messages in SendGrid logs

## 🧪 Manual SendGrid API Test

To verify your SendGrid API key works independently of Supabase:

```bash
curl -X "POST" \
  "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"personalizations":[{"to":[{"email":"me@ian.ng"}]}],"from":{"email":"YOUR_VERIFIED_SENDER_EMAIL"},"subject":"SendGrid Test","content":[{"type":"text/plain","value":"Test email from SendGrid API"}]}'
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY` with your actual API key
- `YOUR_VERIFIED_SENDER_EMAIL` with your verified sender email

## 📊 Common Issues Checklist

**Most Likely Causes**:
- [ ] API key missing "Mail Send" permissions
- [ ] Sender email not verified in SendGrid
- [ ] Incorrect username in Supabase (should be "apikey")
- [ ] API key copied incorrectly (extra spaces/characters)
- [ ] SendGrid account needs verification

**Less Likely But Possible**:
- [ ] Wrong SMTP port or host
- [ ] SendGrid account suspended
- [ ] API key revoked/expired
- [ ] Domain authentication incomplete

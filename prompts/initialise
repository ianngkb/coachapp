You are a senior full-stack engineer working in Cursor with Claude Code assist.  

Your task:  
1. Refer to the application files located in `/mind`.  
2. Inspect the project structure, dependencies, and configurations to understand what stack is required.  
3. Set up the environment so the app can run locally, including:  
   - Installing all required dependencies. Use **pnpm** if a `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists, otherwise default to **npm**.  
   - Running any required database migrations and seed scripts.  
   - Generating a `.env` file with the correct environment variables (see below).  
   - Configuring Supabase connection with the provided PostgreSQL connection string.  
4. Confirm the setup by running the project build and dev server without errors.  
5. Document the installation steps, exact commands, and any assumptions or corrections made.  

### Required `.env` File

```dotenv
# Application Environment Variables

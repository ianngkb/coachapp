    "vision_statement": "A mobile-first scheduling platform that empowers coaches to easily share their availability and manage lessons, while giving students a simple way to discover, book, and manage coaching sessions — all in one place. Unlike Calendly, this app is built specifically for coaching, with a public coach directory as its centerpiece.",
    "problem": {
      "coaches": "Managing schedules manually or across multiple tools leads to double bookings, lost time, and poor visibility for potential students.",
      "students": "Finding a coach and aligning schedules is a messy process (DMs, WhatsApp chains, manual payments).",
      "both": "Existing tools like Calendly are too general-purpose — they don’t support discovery, coaching workflows, or a shared marketplace."
    },
    "opportunity": [
      "Create the 'Calendly for Coaches', starting with sports and skills training.",
      "Provide a trusted marketplace: one place to browse, compare, and book.",
      "Build habits: once students adopt it for booking, it becomes the default way they interact with their coach."
    ],
    "core_value_proposition": {
      "coaches": [
        "A professional profile in a central directory.",
        "Easy tools to set availability and prevent double booking.",
        "Visibility to new students they might never reach otherwise."
      ],
      "students": [
        "Browse a directory of available coaches.",
        "See up-to-date availability (in GMT+8).",
        "Book instantly — no back-and-forth."
      ]
    },
    "principles": [
      "Mobile-first: Optimized for one-thumb booking on the go.",
      "Simple by design: The app does two things really well — availability & scheduling.",
      "Coach-centric directory: Discovery is a first-class feature.",
      "Consistent time zone: All times stored and displayed in GMT+8 (server-controlled).",
      "Scalable foundation: Start lean, expand to payments, reviews, group sessions later."
    ],
    "mvp_features": [
      "Coach Directory – searchable and filterable list of all listed coaches.",
      "Coach Profiles – bio, services offered, availability, and booking button.",
      "Availability Management (Coach) – weekly schedules, exceptions, and time off.",
      "Booking Flow (Student) – select service, pick a slot, confirm booking.",
      "Dashboards – students see 'My Sessions,' coaches see 'My Bookings.'"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Students can find and book a coach within 3 taps.",
      "Coaches can set up a profile and availability in under 10 minutes.",
      "No double bookings; bookings always reflect coach availability in GMT+8.",
      "Directory becomes the default entry point for discovering coaches."
    ],
    "long_term_vision": [
      "Add payments, ratings, and messaging to make the app a full coaching marketplace.",
      "Expand from 1:1 lessons to group clinics, workshops, and events.",
      "Integrate with external calendars (Google, iCal) and communication platforms (WhatsApp reminders, push notifications).",
      "Extend to other verticals beyond sports: music teachers, language tutors, personal trainers."

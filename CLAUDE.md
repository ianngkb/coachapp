# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Knowledge Base
**IMPORTANT**: When working on this application, always consult the comprehensive documentation in the `/mind` directory as your primary knowledge base:
- All technical decisions, architectural patterns, and implementation guidelines are documented there
- Refer to these files before making any coding decisions or architectural choices
- The `/mind` directory contains the complete specification for this coach booking marketplace application

## Project Overview
This is a mobile-first coach booking marketplace application focused on sports and skills training. The app connects coaches with students through a central directory and scheduling platform, specifically designed for the Malaysian market with GMT+8 timezone handling.

**Core Value Proposition**: A "Calendly for Coaches" with built-in discovery through a public coach directory, allowing students to browse, compare, and instantly book coaching sessions.

## Project Status
This project is currently in the **active development phase**. The Next.js foundation has been implemented with initial components. The repository contains comprehensive design documents, technical specifications, and screen definitions that serve as the foundation for development.

## Development Tracking Requirements

### Code Change Documentation
**MANDATORY**: After every code change (no matter how small), Claude must immediately document in this file:

1. **What was changed**: Brief description of the specific changes made (features, bug fixes, refactors, docs)
2. **Files touched**: List of specific files or modules modified
3. **Follow-up steps**: Any TODOs or next actions required

This acts as a running **"what changed" companion log** for developers, distinct from `devlog.md` (which contains high-level development summaries).

3. **Role-based Dashboards** - Separate interfaces for coaches and students
4. **Google Calendar Integration** - Two-way sync for coaches
5. **Malaysian Localization** - RM currency, local phone formatting, GMT+8 timezone
6. **Mobile-first Design** - One-thumb usability principles
7. **Review System** - Post-session ratings and feedback

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style (from mind/identity.md)
- Use early returns for better readability
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling (avoid CSS tags)
- Use descriptive variable and function names with "handle" prefix for event functions
- Implement accessibility features on all elements
- Use const instead of functions: `const toggle = () =>`
- Define TypeScript types wherever possible
- Follow DRY principles and write bug-free, fully functional code

### Testing Guidelines (from mind/identity.md)
Follow strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) with this workflow:

1. **Write Tests First** - Generate complete test cases based on expected input/output pairs using Jest
2. **Run Tests and Confirm Failure** - Execute tests to confirm they fail (no implementation exists)
3. **Commit the Tests** - Commit only test files, no implementation code
4. **Implement the Code** - Write minimal code to make tests pass, never modify test files
5. **Run Tests Until Green** - Iterate on implementation until all tests pass
6. **Independent Verification** - Verify correctness beyond tests with static reasoning and additional inputs
7. **Commit Final Code** - Commit implementation once all tests pass and verification is complete
8. **Visual Regression Testing** - Use Puppeteer for UI screenshot comparison against baselines

**Key Testing Rules**:
- Always follow sequence: write tests → run & fail → commit tests → implement → pass tests → verify → visual test → commit code
- Never modify tests to fit the code
- Prefer unit tests first, then expand to integration, end-to-end, and visual regression tests
- Tests must be isolated, reproducible, and easy to read

### Architecture Principles
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for one-thumb booking
- **Single Page Application**: State-based routing with authentication guards
- **GMT+8 Consistency**: All times stored and displayed in Malaysian timezone
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) with least-privilege policies
- **Performance**: Optimized with caching, proper indexing, and minimal re-renders

### Monitoring and Error Tracking (from mind/sentry.md)
**Sentry Configuration**: Complete error tracking, performance monitoring, and structured logging setup

**Setup Requirements**:
- Run `npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs --saas --org base-61 --project javascript-nextjs` during initial setup
- Configure client-side initialization in `instrumentation-client.ts`
- Configure server-side initialization in `sentry.server.config.ts`
- Configure edge runtime initialization in `sentry.edge.config.ts`

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Use `Sentry.captureException(error)` for exception handling in try-catch blocks
- Implement custom spans with `Sentry.startSpan()` for UI interactions and API calls
- Add meaningful `op` and `name` properties for span identification
- Attach relevant attributes using `span.setAttribute()` for context
- Enable structured logging with `_experiments: { enableLogs: true }`
- Use console logging integration for automatic error capture
- Import consistently: `import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs"`

**DSN**: `https://5d1f04c28446b5cd41e5ac3abd65c74c@o4510016221216768.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510016344752128`
